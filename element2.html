        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Types of Operating system</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Batch Operating System
          <p>Some computer processes are very lengthy and time-consuming.
            To speed the same process,
             a job with a similar type of needs are batched together and run as a group.
             The user of a batch operating system never directly interacts with the computer.
             In this type of OS, every user prepares his or her job on an offline device like
             a punch card and submit it to the computer operator.</p>
           </li>
           <li>Multi-Tasking/Time-sharing Operating systems
             <p>Time-sharing operating system enables people located at a
                different terminal(shell) to use a single computer system at the same time.
                 The processor time (CPU) which is shared among multiple users is termed as time sharing</p>
           </li>
           <li>Real time OS
             <p>A real time operating system time interval to process and respond to inputs is very small.
                Examples: Military Software Systems, Space Software Systems.</p>
           </li>
           <li>Distributed Operating System
             <p>Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines
               to provide very fast computation to its users.</p>
           </li>
           <li>Network Operating System
             <p>Network Operating System runs on a server. It provides the capability to serve to manage data,
                user, groups, security, application, and other networking functions.</p>
           </li>
           <li>Mobile OS
             <p>Mobile operating systems are those OS which
                is especially that are designed to power smartphones,
                tablets, and wearables devices.</p>
