        <h2>Batch processing</h2>
        <p>Batch processing is a technique in which an Operating System collects
          the programs and data together in a batch before processing starts.
           An operating system does the following activities related to batch processing:âˆ’</p>
           <ul style="font-size:20px;">
             <li>The OS defines a job which has predefined sequence of commands, programs and data as a single unit.</li>
             <li>The OS keeps a number a jobs in memory and executes them without any manual information.</li>
             <li>Jobs are processed in the order of submission, i.e., first come first served fashion</li>
             <li>When a job completes its execution, its memory is released and the output for the
                job gets copied into an output spool for later printing or processing.</li>
           </ul>

           <h2>Advantages</h2>
           <ul style="font-size:20px;">
             <li>Batch processing takes much of the work of the operator to the computer.</li>
             <li>Increased performance as a new job get started as soon as the previous job is finished,
               without any manual intervention.</li>
           </ul>
           <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
           <ul style="font-size:20px;">
             <li>Difficult to debug program.</li>
             <li>A job could enter an infinite loop.</li>
             <li>Due to lack of protection scheme, one batch job can affect pending jobs.</li>
           </ul>
